# install JavaScript Standard Style
npm install standard --global

# install for ECMAScript
npm install babel-eslint --save-dev

# edit package.json and add:
   ...
  "standard": {
    "parser": "babel-eslint"
  },
  ...

# check code
standard

# fix the warnings
standard --fix

# check for outdated packages that should be upgraded
npm outdated

# upgrade to the latest - this didn't seem to work
npm upgrade --latest

# above didn't seem to work, so I manually updated package.json, deleted node_modules, and ran npm install
